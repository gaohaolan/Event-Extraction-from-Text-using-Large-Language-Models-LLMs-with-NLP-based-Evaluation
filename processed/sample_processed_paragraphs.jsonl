If so, he will probably be a good deal puzzled by the large number of birthplaces which this particular \"native stream\" seems to possess. Countless rills ooze from mossy beds in all directions, and there seems no particular reason why any one should be chosen more than any other."}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 1, "text": "For my own part, so bent was I upon doing my duty to the full, that for two mortal hours I tore about those fells, tracking stream after stream to its fountain head with a copy of Thorne's \"Rambles by Rivers\" open in my hand at page 11, where there is a picture purporting to represent \"The Source of the Duddon.\" Alas! each stream that I ascended led me at length to a place with a crag, a stone or two, and a tiny brook, just like James Thorne's picture and so soon as I hadn't decided upon one, I was sure to find half a dozen others which answered just as well."}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 2, "text": "The stream, however, upon which I finally fixed as the one which, from its beauty, the poet is most likely to have followed, may be thus identified. As soon as the traveller from Landale reaches the \"Three-Shire Stone,\" let him turn sharply to the right and at a distance of about two hundred yards he will come to a deep cleft hung with a tapestry of bracken and parsley fern, and roofed by the interwoven branches of two mountain ashes springing from the rock on either hand. Just above this grotto the stream divides, the right-hand branch leading to the highest, the farthest, and therefore, geographically speaking, the source of the Duddon, while the left-hand branch leads to a spot more nearly answering to the description in the Sonnets, which we may therefore call the poetic source. At this point there is no open prospect ; nothing but bare crags, scattered boulders, ling, and moss. The very Spirit of Desolation seems to brood around, and the blast goes ever moaning through the pass beneath. Here we find the \"gleam of brilliant moss\" which the poet notes - a patch of bog-moss showing up brightly amid the dark heather - and here we note the \"trembling eyebright,\" the \"purple thyme,\" and those \"sundry flowers\" of hardy constitution for which the tiniest gully forms a sufficient shelter even on this bleak mountain."}

{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 4, "text": "till at length, its volume having grown at every step, it reaches the brow of the hill with its infancy behind it and its fate at hand. Like some poetic nature living unnoticed and solitary, but ever gaining strength for the crisis of life, this river has hitherto meandered through desert places ; but now the crisis is come, and with one bold plunge Duddon leaps into life, hurls himself headlong from the precipice, and so, by a series of cascades, foams his way down to the foot of Wyrnose Fell."}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 5, "text": "A less perilous path conducts the traveller to the same position, and he finds himself in that most barren and forbidding region known as Wrynose Bottom. On either hand hangs a dark mountain, so steep that the vast blocks of stone which cover it look as though they might at any moment come slipping in a deadly avalanche upon the wayfarer."}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 6, "text": "The first sign of human life is the little house at Cockley Beck - that \"cottage rude and grey\" of which Wordsworth sang in one of the sweetest of his sonnets. It is situated just at the bend of the stream, where Duddon emerges from Wrynose Bottom, and turns to pursue a southerly course between the counties of Cumberland and Lancashire. As we round the corner, the green trees clustered about the cottage break with a sense of relief upon the eye, and almost involuntarily we look for those \"ruddy children,\" whom the poet paused to watch at their sport. Alas! where are they? They are grey and wrinkled, or lying perhaps in Seathwaite churchyard. And yet, as I stood there upon Cockley Brig and gazed at the little cottage, so literally was the poet's picture reproduced, that the young mother actually came forth from the door, the \"ruddy children\" of another generation playing merrily beside her. So \"one generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.\""}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 7, "text": "And now we find ourselves in a more generous region, as we pursue the course of the stream through vagrant meadows. \"I shall never forget,\" says Mr. Rawnsley, in a note to Professor Knight's edition of Wordsworth, \"the beauty or the size of the golden feathery spikes of sweet scented gallium, lady's bedstrawm or the wonderful odour of the selfheal, and the glory of the harebells, as I saw them carpeting the meadows near Cockley Beck.\" Through such meadows I pursued the stream for half a mile, and found myself at length nearing a solitary farmhouse; but long before I reached it a hound came rushing across the fields, leaping wall after wall, and barking furiously all the way. Fortunately he was muzzled, an unusual precaution where strangers are so few and far between, but one which was soon explained. There was a \"clippin'\" going on; the farmer's care was for fell-lambs, not for chance travellers."}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 8, "text": "And here let me advise the reader by all means to go to a north-country \"clippin',\" if he ever gets the chance. It was a quaint and characteristic sight. With the dalesman down the Duddon it is quite a grand occasion, for their fellow-dalesmen come from far and near to give a helping hand, and, while the men are busy in the byre, the good wife bustles to and fro to provide the needful refreshment. Things are managed here on the give-and-take principle. The yeomen of the Duddon Valley keep no staff of labourers, but Tom o' Thrang helps Reuben o' Langthwaite, and Reuben helps Tom when his turn comes; and so each man goes the round of all the \"clippings,\" the \"clippings\" at different farms being, of course, arranged to fall on different days."}
{"doc_id": "Rix1893_a", "para_id": 9, "text": "I begged leave to watch the operation, and was invited to stay as long as I chose, the farmer's wife hospitably bringing out currant cake and gooseberry wine for the stranger's refreshment. The men were mostly tall, and somewhat gaunt, with big bushy beards. They wore leather leggings, and blue cotton jackets reaching just to the waist and drawn in like a \"garibaldi.\" Each shearer is provided with a \"par sheears\" and a \"sheep-stool\" -- the latter being a kind of bench, across one end of which he straddles. When he is ready for work, the lad whose business it is to keep the shearers provided with sheep brings the animal with its head towards the operator, and by a dexterous twist throws it on its back upon the stool. The fleece is cut away underneath, and then the four legs are tied with a \"sthring\" and the shearer clips the back, working lengthwise from head to tail, and bringing away the fleece in one piece. As he nears the end of the operation he cries \"Sheep!\" and another sheep is then ready for him by the time that he has finished."}

We lingered a few minutes among the rich woods of Wastdale Hall, at the foot of the lake. The whole route from this point down to the sea is full of fertile picturesque beauty. After dining at the village of strands, which is a favorable halting-place for tourists visiting Wast Water, we walked on in the evening to Drigg Station, through a country of hill and dell, wood and water, as rich and soft as the country we had left behind was sterile and sublime. The village of Stainton Bridge, on this route, is a very charming nook. We were in good time for the train at Drigg; and rode home to Ulverstone by the light of the moon."}

My inn promised sadly having two wooden galleries (like Scotland) in front of it. It was indeed an old ill-contrived house, but kept by civil sensible people, so I stay'd two nights with them & fared & slept very comfortably."}
