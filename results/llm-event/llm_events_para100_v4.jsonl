Here the stream again freshens into life, and is very turbulent from this point all the way to Ulpha. The banks, too, are rocky, and often of considerable height, and at one point they form a vista which is somewhat remarkable. The stream takes a sudden and unexpected turn to the right, and, as if by magin, opens up a view down a long straight channel walled in on each side by slabs and pillars of slate. Half way down this corridor, which is known to the natives by the name of Long Dub, is a somewhat noteworthy spot. The forst, or some other of Nature's agents, has here split off a quantity of slate in thin slabs, and these slabs have got themselves jammed together at all sorts of angles, the interstices being filled with luxuriant growth of feathery fern. Here a rill trickles down and falls into the river by a miniature cascade, and just beyond it is a cliff of rock, some twelve or fifteen feet in height, overhanging a deep sullen pool, where the thick foliage of oak and beech casts a black shadow on the waters.

This foot-path went through gates and over stiles, through fair meadows, where swains were mowing the grass diamonded with morning dew; by beautiful country-seats, buried deep in shrubbery, all lovely in the sunny morning. Millions of harebells opened their blue eyes, or rather hung their bells, to welcome the day; and the wild honeysuckle, in the hedges, filled the air with fragrance. So I passed on to Rydal.
