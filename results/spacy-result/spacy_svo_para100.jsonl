This excursion was got up by the members of the Roscoe Club; a society consisting principally of the young men of Liverpool, engaged in commerce, and who unite together for mutual instruction and recreation. We left Liverpool by rail at about 9 o’clock, and reached Bowness, on Lake Windermere, in about three hours. At Bowness we took a little steamer, and sailed to Ambleside at the other extremity. I walked from Ambleside to Rydal, and saw Wordsworth’s house. Understanding that he was not at home, and following the example of other sight-seers, who seemed to make themselves quite at home in his premises, I also walked into his little domain, and stood on the terrace before his house, where he has so often stood to look over Lake Windermere and at the stormy summit of Loughrigg. Then I climbed Knabscar behind his house, whence a very fine view of the lake scenery is to be obtained. It was tough work for a hot day, but amply repaid me. There lay Windermere, stretching far away to the south, and Ambleside between, its stone cottages embosomed in foliage, its white road running between green hedges to the foot of the hill; and away in the distance rose a great mountain form, which much attracted me, but which, I found by the map afterward, must have been Helvellyn, only four or five miles off. Though I did not know that Helvellyn was in the neighborhood, and had supposed it to be a Scotch mountain, I was repeating to myself constantly, while on Knabscar, Scott’s lines, --", "events": [{"subject": "I", "verb": "Reaching", "object": "Liverpool", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "make", "object": "an excursion", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "This excursion", "verb": "got up", "object": null, "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "We", "verb": "left", "object": "Liverpool", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "We", "verb": "reached", "object": "Bowness", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "we", "verb": "took", "object": "a little steamer", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "walked", "object": "Ambleside", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "saw", "object": "Wordsworth’s house", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "Understanding", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "he", "verb": "following", "object": null, "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "seemed", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "make", "object": "themselves", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "walked into", "object": "his little domain", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "stood", "object": "the terrace", "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "he", "verb": "stood", "object": null, "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "he", "verb": "look over", "object": "Lake Windermere", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "he", "verb": "look over", "object": "at the stormy summit of Loughrigg", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "climbed", "object": "Knabscar", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "a very fine view", "verb": "obtained", "object": null, "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "its white road", "verb": "rose", "object": null, "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "know (neg)", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "supposed", "object": "it", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "seemed", "object": "other sight-seers", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "he", "verb": "stood", "object": "his house", "verb_category": "nature"}]}

This was the Nature which he had interpreted and idealized. There was a glory upon these hills, not known to sea or land elsewhere, but borrowed from the poet’s dream. The landscape was made alive by the power of thought; pervaded throughout with soul, humanized and elevated by the wonderful magic of the imagination. I very much enjoyed the breezy top of the mountain, bare of every thing but grass and heather.

Presently I found myself engaged in a very pleasant conversation with this party, who proved to be from Manchester, and the family of Mr. B., member of Parliament for that place. We talked about America and England, Mr. Emerson, and Emanuel Swedenborg, the Peace Congress, the poet Wordsworth, and the doctrine of the Trinity. On the latter topic we could not well agree; they being Swedenborgians, and I a Unitarian, I quarrelled with Swedenborg’s doctrine of the Lord, on the ground that he seemed to me, while maintaining the divinity of Christ, to lose his humanity, declaring that the soul of Christ was God himself. This, I thought, made the humanity a mere name; for a human body without a human soul, is surely not a human being; and it nullified those Scriptures, in which Jesus asserts his dependence on the Father.

{"doc_id": "clarke1852_e", "para_id": 4, "text": "Next morning I arose at five to walk to Grasmere to breakfast. I walked by a private path through the fields to Rydal. This foot-path went through gates and over stiles, through fair meadows, where swains were mowing the grass diamonded with morning dew; by beautiful country-seats, buried deep in shrubbery, all lovely in the sunny morning. Millions of harebells opened their blue eyes, or rather hung their bells, to welcome the day; and the wild honeysuckle, in the hedges, filled the air with fragrance. So I passed on to Rydal. There I again turned from the road into another foot-path which skirted Rydal Water, and at last I came in view of the village of Grasmere lying beyond its lake. Here I was seized with the mad desire of getting across the little River Rothay, by which Grasmere debouches into Rydal. It was swollen by the rain, and so, as I stepped from slippery rock to rock, my pole, plucked from the hedge, snapped, and I tumbled in. My hat flew from my head immediately, dipped itself half full of water, and was just going to the bottom when I caught it. There I stood, with the water about my waist, taking my morning bath in a very unexpected manner. Emptying a quart of water from my hat, I scrambled up the bank, walked a mile and a half to the village of Grasmere, and, ordering breakfast, sat by the kitchen fire to see it cooked while I dried my clothes. The cook was a rosy English lass, and I advised her to go to America; but she knew better and said, ‘It is too far; I might set out’ said she, ‘but I am afraid I should never get there.’ This cook was almost the only person whom I saw among the working classes in Europe, who was not thinking more or less seriously of moving to America. America is an ideal world to the peasantry of Europe. It supplies them with hope; and even to those who never go there it is a blessing, in giving them a hope of improving their condition. It is the El Dorado, the land of golden plenty, where every man can have a home of his own, and leave his children comfortable when he dies. Let it be known any where in Europe that you are an American, and you are at once welcomed by the common people. Each one has something to say to you about America; something to ask about friends living there; about wages, price of land, and modes of living.", "events": [{"subject": "I", "verb": "walk", "object": "Grasmere", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "walked through", "object": "a private path", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "This foot-path", "verb": "went through through", "object": "gates", "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "Millions", "verb": "opened", "object": "their blue eyes", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "Millions", "verb": "hung", "object": "their bells", "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "passed on", "object": "Rydal", "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "turned into", "object": "the road", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "came", "object": "view", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "getting across", "object": "the little River Rothay", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "tumbled in", "object": null, "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "My hat", "verb": "going", "object": "the bottom", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "stood", "object": "the water", "verb_category": "nature"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "taking", "object": "my morning bath", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "walked", "object": "the village", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "see", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "advised", "object": "her", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "go", "object": "America", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "she", "verb": "knew", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "she", "verb": "said", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "set out", "object": null, "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "she", "verb": "said", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "get (neg)", "object": null, "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "saw", "object": "whom", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "thinking (neg)", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "moving", "object": "America", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "go (neg)", "object": null, "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "it", "verb": "giving", "object": "a hope", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "It", "verb": "leave", "object": "his children", "verb_category": "action"}, {"subject": "it", "verb": "known", "object": null, "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "Each one", "verb": "say about", "object": "you", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "I", "verb": "saw", "object": "almost the only person", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "thinking", "object": "the working classes", "verb_category": "mental"}, {"subject": "who", "verb": "go", "object": "those", "verb_category": "action"}]}

The hall on Coniston Water was the chief seat for many years but on a marriage with the heiress of Knott ofRydal they removed it as I take it, and have since remained there.
